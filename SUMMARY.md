# Sound Downloader CLI Tool - Summary

## What We've Created

We've built a command-line interface (CLI) tool that can:

1. Process single URLs for EpidemicSound tracks
2. Process multiple URLs from a text file
3. Automatically organize downloaded files in an "audio" directory
4. Provide helpful command-line instructions

## Files Created

1. `epidownloader.py` - The main Python script
2. `requirements.txt` - Lists required Python packages
3. `urls.txt` - Sample file with example URLs
4. `README.md` - Documentation and usage instructions
5. `epidownloader.bat` - Windows batch file for easier execution

## How It Works

The tool works by:
1. Taking either a single URL or a file containing multiple URLs
2. Sending requests to the Fetchpik service for each URL
3. Extracting track IDs from the URLs
4. Creating placeholder files (in a full implementation, this would download actual audio files)

## Usage Examples

1. For a single URL:
   ```
   python epidownloader.py -u "https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/ihOLYFXRXp/"
   ```

2. For multiple URLs from a file:
   ```
   python epidownloader.py -f urls.txt
   ```

## Next Steps for a Production Implementation

To make this tool work with the actual Fetchpik service, you would need to:

1. Analyze the exact response format from Fetchpik
2. Extract the actual download URLs from the response
3. Update the `process_single_url()` function to parse the real download links
4. Handle any anti-bot measures or authentication that Fetchpik might implement

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that demonstrates the CLI interface and file organization system.
