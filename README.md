> [!WARNING]
> **Please read Artlist's [Terms of Service](https://artlist.io/help-center/privacy-terms/terms-of-use/) before using this script.**
> This script is intended for personal use only to listen to music offline. Use responsibly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This userscript enables you to download **music** and **sound effects** from Artlist.io without requiring an account or dealing with watermarks. The script automatically modifies download buttons to bypass account requirements and download audio files directly.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

[**INSTALL USERSCRIPT**](https://github.com/sulmanfarooqq/OrangeMonkey/raw/main/artlist-downloader.user.js)

### Prerequisites
You need a userscript manager extension:

- **[TamperMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)**
- **[OrangeMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/orangemonkey/ekmeppjgajofkpiofbebgcbohbmfldaf)** (Recommended)

## 📖 How It Works

The script works by:

1. **Intercepting API requests** to Artlist's backend to capture audio metadata
2. **Modifying download buttons** by:
   - Changing button colors (green for music, pink for sound effects)
   - Adding custom click handlers that bypass account requirements
   - Directly downloading audio files instead of showing signup prompts
3. **Supporting multiple page types**:
   - Music browsing pages (`artlist.io/royalty-free-music`)
   - Sound effects pages (`artlist.io/sfx`)
   - Individual song/sound effect pages
   - Song stem pages (downloads as ZIP)

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **No account required** - Bypasses Artlist account system
- ✅ **No watermarks** - Downloads original audio files
- ✅ **Automatic detection** - Works on various Artlist page layouts
- ✅ **Batch downloading** - Download multiple stems as ZIP files
- ✅ **Organized filenames** - Files named as `Artist - Song Name (ID).aac`
