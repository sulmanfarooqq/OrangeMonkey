> I'm personally only using this to listen to the music outside of the website, locally.

> [!WARNING]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This user-script enables you to download **music** and **sound effects** from the artlist without making an account, and without any watermarks. The userscript overrides the download button in the UI to download the audio file linked to that music or sound effect instead of popping up a menu for you to make an account and get a license.
